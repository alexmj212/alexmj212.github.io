                        <li>This project was a great opportunity to exercise most of my strengths
                            with front end development. I really enjoyed working with the
                            feature focused-team and coming together to complete a major project.
                            Mobile-focused projects more prevalent not just at TwinSpires but in the
                            industry as a whole.

                            for customers. I mastered the complexity around video display in desktop
