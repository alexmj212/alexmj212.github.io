        Hey, my name is Alex!
    </p>
    <p>I love making products that people can actually use. For 7 years, I have worked with many kinds of
        front-end technologies to deliver great user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to work on a team to create user-centric products. From internal
        adminstrative applications to features used by all audiences, I focus on every detail of design,
        usability, and experience.
