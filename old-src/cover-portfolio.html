        <p> To whom it may concern: </p>
        <p> I am an enthusiastic software developer currently seeking a front end developer position. I
            focus
            on
            communication to ensure that project goals are met. I am always looking for solutions to
            help the team and get things done.</p>
        <p> At <i>The Jockey Club Technology Services</i>, I have worked on many applications and
            systems that support the thoroughbred racing industry. I have designed and implemented
            educational tools and applications that provide course material and management for various
            industry
            related certifications. I have also worked with several international clients in developing
            complex
            mathematical models to assess the performance of thoroughbreds. </p>
        <p> In additional to various thoroughbred racing initiatives, I have worked with several regulatory
            agencies within the industry such as the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau that works to
            collect
            and monitor betting transactions throughout the US. This involves coordinating many Totalizer
            companies in order to establish data transfer protocols and procedures. Further, I contributed
            to
            the design and implementation data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) systems that
            handle
            a large volume of critical transaction data. </p>
        <p> During my time at <i>iEntry, Inc.</i> I worked on nearly every critical company application and
            server including several web farms, database servers, proxy servers, MTA servers, and virtual
            servers. These servers run various flavors of Linux and Windows. I was manager of several tools
            used
            by many of the employees including Wordpress and several custom-built applications critical to
            company functions. I also managed many desktop Mac installations running OS X and Windows. I
            helped
            design several new tools for other employees such as a statistical application to track
            marketing
            data and modifications to critical business tools. </p>
        <p> I spent two years in Desktop Support and Technical Helpdesk at the <i>University of
                Kentucky.</i> In
            this position, I supported Microsoft Windows (XP, 7, and 8), Mac OSX, and Linux Operating
            systems.
            In the position, I gained extensive knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite and Microsoft
            Exchange.
            I helped manage a user base of over 500+ desktops across campus and often worked directly with
            users
            via our ticketing system, email, over the phone, and most often in person. </p>
        <p> As a student, I worked with a team of 4 to develop a cloud-based application constructed on
            Amazon
            Web Services. We used the web framework, Django in concert with MySQL and MongoDB. This
            application
            used API’s to access health data from personal health services. We visualized this data via a
            jQuery
            application. </p>

        <div><strong>Description</strong></div>
        <p>I was involved the implementation of a responsive redesign of the data reporting system for the
            Thoroughbred Racing Protive Bureau. This system is used by many users in order to
            monitor and report on betting transaction data. In addition to the reporting functionality, I
            participated in the the design and implementation of the extraction,
            transformation, and loading system that took multiple data source feeds and made them available
            via
            the reporting application. This interface used a RESTful service backend
            and an AngularJS front end for receiving and parsing the data service requests. </p>

        <div><strong>Description</strong></div>
        <p>This project involved a complete reimplementation of an existing site from a legacy code base and
            database into Drupal. This involved a complex data import using Entity
            Relationships inside Drupal to attain a similar data relationship from the legacy database. In
            addition, the client requested a responsive design implementation. The site is used
            for the management of horse racing officials through out the racing industry. Users would be
            provided with a login and a profile that allowed them to display their particular
            accreditation
            and certificates in various officiated capacities. The site also allowed them to post for job
            availability and seek employment. Further, the site also had a course registration
            functionality that allowed the organization to track enrollment and participation.</p>

        <div><strong>Description</strong></div>
        <p> I was involved in the responsive implementation of the design for this Drupal commentary
            blog. The
            blog has a large international audience in the thoroughbred racing industry. The
            design goal of the blog was to maintain a clean interface in the mobile view while providing
            advertisement space and the ease of reading of long form content. Additionally, the
            site
            incuded a mechanism to view international thoroughbred, jockey, trainer, and owner ratings. This
            component was a custom page using Angular and Bootstrap.</p>

        <h2>Trending Topic Collection Application</h2>
        <b>2013 - iEntry, Inc.</b>
        <p>
            <small>jQuery, CakePHP, MySQL, CentOS</small>
        </p>
        <div><strong>Description</strong></div>
        <p>I was the primary developer for this application. This project is a modification of an existing
            tool
            that is used by 50+ staff and contracted authors. Its main function is to keep
            track of topics covered by the writers and to gather potential trends. Trends are collected from
            Yahoo, Bing, and Google in addition to trend related articles. A weight is
            calculated
            based on the frequency they are seen. The page orders the trends based on their weight; the more
            popular the trend, the better the target. Over time, if a trend is not seen on
            search
            engines, it will slowly drop to the bottom of the list as it is no longer relevant. Individuals
            can
            claim each trend, the claim is indicated to all other writers.</p>

        </div>
        <div><strong>Results</strong></div>
        <p>The implementation of this project directly resulted in a long-term increase in page views for
            the
            blog. The back-end systems were optimized to accommodate an increase
            in the number
            of
            writers. The system is extensible and modifiable to include additional trend sources. Functions
            were
            built-in to maintain a small database footprint and clean old data
            resulting in
            faster look-ups and an overall more efficient application.</p>
        <h2>Author Payment System</h2>

        <div><strong>Description</strong></div>
        <p>I was the primary developer for this application. This is a modification of an existing system
            that
            replaces manual weekly reports done by hand for 50+ authors. The
            reporting system
            collects relevant data from the database article records and generates a personalized email for
            each
            author Each author needs to confirm his or her report via email
            or via the
            interface. These reports are saved into a database for moderation. Totals are also calculated to
            provide an overview of that weeks report. Previous reports can be
            accessed via the
            pagination functions at the top of the page.</p>

        </div>
        <div><strong>Results</strong></div>
        <p>Before this system was implemented, reports were calculated and collected by hand and manually
            confirmed with each of the 50+ authors. With this system
            handling all report
            generation
            and confirmation, hours of manual weekly reports are reduced to a minimum. In addition, this
            system
            can scale to handle additional authors as needed without
            increasing
            workload.</p>
