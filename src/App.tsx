            For 7 years, I have delivered great user experiences using a wide variety of technologies. I have coordinated teams to deliver feature-rich projects from idea to production. I focus on design, usability, and user experience to create
            products for all audiences using modern concepts and practices.

            When I was young, I learned how to build basic web pages. This led to learning graphic design and creating images to use in layouts on my personal web pages. Even before finishing high school, I quickly decided that I wanted to pursue a
            career in front-end web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long after, I graduated from the <strong>University of Kentucky</strong> in 2013 with a <i>B.S. in Computer Science</i>. While I was there, I studied discrete mathmatics, web development, and compilers. I also picked up some helpful
            skills including regular expressions, databases, and object-oriented programming.
