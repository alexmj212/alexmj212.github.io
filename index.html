                <p> To whom it may concern: </p>
                <p> I am an enthusiastic software developer currently seeking a front end developer position. I focus
                    on
                    communication to ensure that project goals are met. I am always looking for solutions to
                    help the team and get things done.</p>
                <p> At <i>The Jockey Club Technology Services</i>, I have worked on many applications and
                    systems that support the thoroughbred racing industry. I have designed and implemented
                    educational tools and applications that provide course material and management for various industry
                    related certifications. I have also worked with several international clients in developing complex
                    mathematical models to assess the performance of thoroughbreds. </p>
                <p> In additional to various thoroughbred racing initiatives, I have worked with several regulatory
                    agencies within the industry such as the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau that works to collect
                    and monitor betting transactions throughout the US. This involves coordinating many Totalizer
                    companies in order to establish data transfer protocols and procedures. Further, I contributed to
                    the design and implementation data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) systems that handle
                    a large volume of critical transaction data. </p>
                <p> During my time at <i>iEntry, Inc.</i> I worked on nearly every critical company application and
                    server including several web farms, database servers, proxy servers, MTA servers, and virtual
                    servers. These servers run various flavors of Linux and Windows. I was manager of several tools used
                    by many of the employees including Wordpress and several custom-built applications critical to
                    company functions. I also managed many desktop Mac installations running OS X and Windows. I helped
                    design several new tools for other employees such as a statistical application to track marketing
                    data and modifications to critical business tools. </p>
                <p> I spent two years in Desktop Support and Technical Helpdesk at the <i>University of Kentucky.</i> In
                    this position, I supported Microsoft Windows (XP, 7, and 8), Mac OSX, and Linux Operating systems.
                    In the position, I gained extensive knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite and Microsoft Exchange.
                    I helped manage a user base of over 500+ desktops across campus and often worked directly with users
                    via our ticketing system, email, over the phone, and most often in person. </p>
                <p> As a student, I worked with a team of 4 to develop a cloud-based application constructed on Amazon
                    Web Services. We used the web framework, Django in concert with MySQL and MongoDB. This application
                    used API’s to access health data from personal health services. We visualized this data via a jQuery
                    application. </p>

                    monitor and report on betting transaction data. In addition to the reporting functionality, I
                    participated in the the design and implementation of the extraction,
                    transformation, and loading system that took multiple data source feeds and made them available via
                    the reporting application. This interface used a RESTful service backend

                    addition, the client requested a responsive design implementation. The site is used
                    for the management of horse racing officials through out the racing industry. Users would be
                    provided with a login and a profile that allowed them to display their particular
                    accreditation
                    and certificates in various officiated capacities. The site also allowed them to post for job
                    availability and seek employment. Further, the site also had a course registration
                    functionality that allowed the organization to track enrollment and participation.</p>

                <p>I was the primary developer for this application. This project is a modification of an existing tool
                    that is used by 50+ staff and contracted authors. Its main function is to keep
                    track of topics covered by the writers and to gather potential trends. Trends are collected from
                    Yahoo, Bing, and Google in addition to trend related articles. A weight is
                    calculated
                    based on the frequency they are seen. The page orders the trends based on their weight; the more
                    popular the trend, the better the target. Over time, if a trend is not seen on
                    search
                    engines, it will slowly drop to the bottom of the list as it is no longer relevant. Individuals can
                    claim each trend, the claim is indicated to all other writers.</p>

                <p>The implementation of this project directly resulted in a long-term increase in page views for the
                    blog. The back-end systems were optimized to accommodate an increase
                    in the number
                    of
                    writers. The system is extensible and modifiable to include additional trend sources. Functions were
                    built-in to maintain a small database footprint and clean old data
                    resulting in
                    faster look-ups and an overall more efficient application.</p>

                <p>I was the primary developer for this application. This is a modification of an existing system that
                    replaces manual weekly reports done by hand for 50+ authors. The

                    collects relevant data from the database article records and generates a personalized email for each
                    author Each author needs to confirm his or her report via email
                    or via the
                    interface. These reports are saved into a database for moderation. Totals are also calculated to
                    provide an overview of that weeks report. Previous reports can be

                <p>Before this system was implemented, reports were calculated and collected by hand and manually
                    confirmed with each of the 50+ authors. With this system
                    handling all report
                    generation
                    and confirmation, hours of manual weekly reports are reduced to a minimum. In addition, this system
                    can scale to handle additional authors as needed without
                    increasing
                    workload.</p>

                <h1 id="prequels">No, really, they were okay.</h1>
                <p> Everyone gets so upset about them like they've ruined Star Wars but
                    actually, they're just fine. Let's think about this for a second. Most people consider Star Wars to
                    be a "space opera" meaning, it's a highly dramatized story that takes place in space. We've clearly
                    got the space thing going on, so let's address the "dramatized" portion of the genre.</p>

                <p>Most critics I know are very quick to lament the terrible melodrama and acting from the main cast,
                    Anakin being the primary target for criticism. While he's
                    clearly not the greatest actor of all, think carefully about his character and the terrible past
                    from which he grew up. He was basically property until he was swept away by the Jedi before puberty,
                    he never had contact with his mother, and when he did, she died in his arms. It's no wonder this kid
                    had
                    abandonment issues. Compounded on that, his lover attempts to distance herself after discovering
                    that he's still very emotionally immature. Who can blame him? It's not the Jedi "we're going to
                    teach you how to be an adult" academy, the conditions he grew up with emotionally stunted him.
                    Forgive the kid for being melodramatic, he's had a terrible life.</p>

                <p>So, he's emotionally scarred from his youth, he's emotionally abandoned by the love of his life, and
                    he's emotionally inept thanks to the Jedi who insisted on using him as a tool to fulfil some crazy
                    prophecy. How can you now feel bad for this guy? Yeah, he's a whiny jerk, but you would be too in
                    his situation.</p>

                <p>Now let's address the issues that people always bring up about the Ferengi knockoffs (Trade
                    Federation sub-story). The entire reason the audience is even involved in the
                    scenes about the trade negotiations is to highlight the corruption that is clearly occurring in the
                    Republic. Through the entire trilogy, hints are dropped about the Sith and possible ties to the
                    Senate, an impending doom builds under the nose of everyone in the movie all wildly signalled since
                    the beginning. The whole intention of this sub-plot was to highlight the ineptitude of the Jedi and
                    demonstrate that evil can appear from where we least expect it (a theme which clearly lines up with
                    the turmoil Anakin is put through and the results of his turmoil). In short, the entire reason we're
                    able to go on an epic space adventure for 3 movies is because these guys were manipulated from the
                    beginning by the Sith. But everyone just dismisses it as some contrived plot-line without
                    substance.</p>

                <p>Jar-Jar. He is the character representation of the audience, the Greek chorus. Jar-jar is supposed to
                    be the relatable character, the one that is
                    forth-coming about his emotions. He represents us. But everyone hates him. If Jar-Jar is really just
                    an extension of the audience, then, the audience must also be repulsed
                    by themselves. To hate Jar-Jar is to hate yourself.</p>
