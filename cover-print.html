                        I am writing to you today to express my interest in your position. I believe I have the
                        experience and skills that would allow me to be a great fit for your company.

                        During my time at iEntry, Inc. I work on nearly every critical company application and server
                        including several web farms, database servers, proxy servers, MTA servers, and virtual servers.
                        These servers run various flavors of Linux and Windows. I am in charge of several tools used by
                        many of the employees including Wordpress and several custom-built applications critical to
                        company functions. I also manage many desktop Mac installations running OS X and Windows. I
                        helped design several new tools for other employees such as a statistical application and
                        modifications to previous tools.

                        I spent two years in Desktop Support and Technical Helpdesk at the University of Kentucky. In
                        this position, I supported Microsoft Windows (XP, 7, and 8), Mac OSX, and Linux Operating
                        systems. In the position, I gained extensive knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite and
                        Microsoft Exchange. I helped manage a user base of over 500+ desktops across campus and often
                        worked directly with users via our ticketing system, email, over the phone, and most often in
                        person.

                        As a student, I worked with a team of 4 to develop a cloud-based application constructed on
                        Amazon Web Services. We used the web framework, Django in concert with MySQL and MongoDB. This
                        application used APIâ€™s to access health data from personal health services. We visualized this
                        data via a jQuery application.
